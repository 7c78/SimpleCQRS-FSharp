Simple CQRS on F# (F-Sharp) 3.0

Based on Greg Young's CQRS: https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r/tree/master/SimpleCQRS

This is F# solution. Compared to C#:
  + Simpler source code
  + No need for any "InfrastructureCrap"
  + Domain objects doesn't need to have parameter less constructors
  + Interactive-driven development
  (+ No locks, uses Message Passing)
  
What you will need to run this:
  + Visual Studio 11 (Beta): http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us
  + Reactive extensions: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609


It uses Reactive Extensions (Rx) Subject-class for message bus and a MailboxProcessor for event storage.
(Either one of them could have been enough by itself.)


First version has just command side and event sourcing.
(Query side is more trivial, I suggest using Type Providers...)
